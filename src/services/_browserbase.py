"""Shared Browserbase helpers for browser-required collectors.

Used by :mod:`openats.collectors.meta` and :mod:`openats.collectors.tesla`,
both of which can only fetch jobs through a real browser context. The
:mod:`openats.collectors.avature` collector has its own inline copy of this
flow predating the shared helper; refactor target for a future cleanup.

Three env vars gate the path:

* ``BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`` + ``BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID`` — credentials.
* ``OPENATS_USE_BROWSERBASE`` (1/true/yes) — explicit opt-in for
  browser-required collectors (meta, tesla). Without it those collectors
  return ``[]`` with a single warning so the pipeline keeps moving.
* ``OPENATS_DISABLE_BROWSERBASE=1`` — emergency kill-switch shared
  with the Avature fallback.
