"""Shared helpers for ``cloakbrowser``-backed collectors.

``cloakbrowser`` is a stealth-patched Chromium fork that ships its own
binary and bypasses every fingerprint check (Akamai, Cloudflare bot
manager, PerimeterX, …). Drop-in Playwright API: same ``page.goto`` /
``page.evaluate`` / ``page.mouse`` surface, just imported from
``cloakbrowser`` instead of ``playwright``. The library auto-downloads
the patched Chromium on first ``launch()`` and caches it under
``~/.cache/cloakbrowser`` — no separate ``playwright install`` step.

Two collectors use cloakbrowser today:

  - ``tesla.py``: Akamai is aggressive on ``tesla.com``. Even
    Browserbase Sessions over residential proxies return 403/429.
    cloakbrowser + ``humanize=True`` + a behavioural warm-up clears
    the bot manager. From a datacenter IP the warm-up is still
    rate-limited so we route through the Evomi residential proxy
    when ``PROXY`` is set; on a residential machine ``PROXY`` is
    typically unset and the warm-up alone suffices.

  - ``meta.py``: GraphQL-driven SPA that needs a real browser to
    issue ``fb_dtsg`` tokens. cloakbrowser handles the cookie
    initialisation transparently; ``humanize`` is optional but
    cheap, so we keep it on for parity with the Tesla path.

Helpers below mirror the structure of :mod:`_browserbase` (which
Avature still uses as its last-resort fallback): ``is_enabled`` /
``require_cloakbrowser`` / ``warn_disabled`` / ``evomi_proxy_from_env``.
The graceful degradation contract is preserved — when ``cloakbrowser``
isn't installed, the collector logs a warning and returns ``[]`` instead
of crashing the publish pipeline.
