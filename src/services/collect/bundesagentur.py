"""Bundesagentur für Arbeit (German federal employment agency) collector.

Single largest open job source we cover: ~1M+ active postings across
every German employer that lists with the agency. The portal at
``arbeitsagentur.de`` exposes a public unauthenticated JSON API that
the official frontend consumes:

    GET https://rest.arbeitsagentur.de/jobboerse/jobsuche-service/pc/v4/jobs
        ?size=100&page={1..100}
    Header: X-API-Key: jobboerse-jobsuche

The API caps pagination at ``size × page = 10,000`` results per query
(``size=100, page=100``). Past that limit, the server returns 400.

To collect the full ~1M jobs we subdivide *recursively* by orthogonal
facets in priority order: ``berufsfeld`` (144 categories) →
``arbeitszeit`` (5 work-time buckets, e.g. ``vz``/``tz``) →
``zeitarbeit`` (2 — temp work yes/no) → ``befristung`` (3 — permanent /
fixed-term / vocational). At each level we only descend if the bucket
still exceeds the 10k cap. Empirically this is enough to break every
oversize category into <10k leaves.

The earlier version subdivided by Bundesland names, but the API's
``arbeitsort`` filter expects *city* names (e.g. ``"Berlin"``,
``"München"``), not states (``"Bayern"`` returns 0) — that bug capped
output at ~301k.

A subsequent 4-facet version (``berufsfeld → arbeitszeit → zeitarbeit →
befristung``) still capped near ~301-500k because the tail facets are
heavily skewed (~84% in the dominant bucket each), so the worst leaf —
Verkauf + vz + false + befristung=3 — still held 56k jobs against a
10k cap. The current 6-facet recursion adds ``eintrittsdatum`` (24
month windows) and ``arbeitgeber`` (top-100 employers per leaf), which
is enough to drive every dominant leaf below 10k.

Single-tenant collector: ``company_slug`` is informational and ignored.
The output rows carry the German employer name as ``company`` so the
publisher's cross-ATS dedup still works.
